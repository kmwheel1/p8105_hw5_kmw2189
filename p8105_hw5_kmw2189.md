## Problem 1

Uses the iris dataset from the tidyverse package and there are some
missing values in each column. The purpose of this problem is to fill in
those missing values.

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

1)  For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the
    mean of non-missing values
2)  For character variables, you should fill in missing values with
    “virginica”

Instructions: Write a function that takes a vector as an argument;
replaces missing values using the rules defined above; and returns the
resulting vector. Apply this function to the columns of
iris\_with\_missing using a map statement.
