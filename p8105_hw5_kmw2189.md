## Problem 1

Uses the iris dataset from the tidyverse package and there are some
missing values in each column. The purpose of this problem is to fill in
those missing values.

1)  For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the
    mean of non-missing values
2)  For character variables, you should fill in missing values with
    “virginica”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

``` r
## write a function that takes a vector as an argument. 
replace_iris = function(col_name){
  

  if(is.numeric(col_name))
    {
    new_value = replace_na(col_name, mean(col_name, na.rm = TRUE))
  } 
  
  else if(is.character(col_name))
    {
    new_value = replace_na(col_name, "virginica")
  }
  
  new_value
}

iris_without_missing = map_dfr(iris_with_missing, replace_iris)
```

## Problem 2

Problem 2 contains data from a longitudinal study that included a
control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is
included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and
arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

``` r
##Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help
files = list.files(path = "./data", pattern = "*.csv", full.names = TRUE) %>% 
  set_names()
```

Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe Tidy
the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID,
make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying
that’s necessary Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each
subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

start with a tibble, this tibble contains file and path use mutate to
pull data. \#\#convert to vector = as.vector \#\#str-c \#\#create a
lable by yourself \#\#pivot longer the week \#\#group cols \#\#map
read.csv
