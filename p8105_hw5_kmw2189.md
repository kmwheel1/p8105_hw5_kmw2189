## Problem 1

Problem 1 uses the iris dataset from the tidyverse package and contains
some missing values in each column. The purpose of this problem is to
fill in those missing values.

1)  For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the
    mean of non-missing values
2)  For character variables, you should fill in missing values with
    “virginica”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

``` r
## write a function that takes a vector as an argument. 
replace_iris = function(col_name){
  

  if(is.numeric(col_name))
    {
    new_value = replace_na(col_name, mean(col_name, na.rm = TRUE))
  } 
  
  else if(is.character(col_name))
    {
    new_value = replace_na(col_name, "virginica")
  }
  
  new_value
}

iris_without_missing = map_dfr(iris_with_missing, replace_iris)
```

## Problem 2

Problem 2 contains data from a longitudinal study that included a
control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is
included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and
arm.

``` r
##Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help
csv_df = tibble (
  file_name = list.files(path = "./data", full.names = TRUE)
) %>% 

##Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe
  
  mutate(
    csv_ouput = map(file_name, read_csv)
    ) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  
##Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary
  
  pivot_longer(
          week_1:week_8,
          names_to = "week",
          names_prefix = "week_",
          values_to = "value"
          ) %>%
   separate(file_name, into = c("remove_1", "remove_2", "temp_1"), sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(
    arm_id = str_replace(temp_1, ".csv", "")
    ) %>% 
  separate(arm_id, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_", remove = FALSE ) %>% 
  select(
    c("arm_id", "arm", "subject_id", "week",  "value")
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    subject_id = as.integer(subject_id),
         arm_id = factor(arm_id),
         arm = factor(arm)
    )  
```

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time.

``` r
csv_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, group = arm_id, color = arm)) +
    geom_line() + 
    labs(
      title = "Observations over time",
      x = "week",
      y = "observation value",
      caption = "Data from a longitudinal study with control arm and experimental arm"
    ) + 
    viridis::scale_color_viridis(
      name = "Arm", 
      discrete = TRUE
    )
```

Comment on differences between groups. The control group appears to have
values that stay relatively constant over time, while the experimental
group appears to have values that increase over the 8 week period.
