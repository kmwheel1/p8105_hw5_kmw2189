## Problem 1

Uses the iris dataset from the tidyverse package and there are some
missing values in each column. The purpose of this problem is to fill in
those missing values.

1)  For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the
    mean of non-missing values
2)  For character variables, you should fill in missing values with
    “virginica”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

``` r
## write a function that takes a vector as an argument. 
replace_iris = function(col_name){
  

  if(is.numeric(col_name))
    {
    new_value = replace_na(col_name, mean(col_name, na.rm = TRUE))
  } 
  
  else if(is.character(col_name))
    {
    new_value = replace_na(col_name, "virginica")
  }
  
  new_value
}

iris_without_missing = map_dfr(iris_with_missing, replace_iris)
```

## Problem 2

Problem 2 contains data from a longitudinal study that included a
control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is
included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and
arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

``` r
##Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help
csv_df = tibble (
  file_name = list.files(path = "./data", full.names = TRUE)
)  

##Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe
  
csv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    csv_ouput = map(file_name, read_csv)
    ) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
          week_1:week_8,
          names_to = "week", 
          values_to = "value"
          )
```
